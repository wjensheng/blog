Predict ideal position for hockey players based on body movements
<!--more-->

#### Introduction
I participated in my very first Datathon organized by Michigan Data Science Team. In a team of 3, we were given 3 datasets and had to choose one to work on. After some discussion, we decided to work on the Catapult wearable device dataset.

#### Dataset
The dataset dated from August 2016 to September 2018 and consisted of GPS, Inertial, Player Load collected from Catapult Wearable Devices. A total of data points for 31 anonymized unique players from Michigan Hockey Team was available to us.

#### Position descriptions
To start, there are a few positions in a hockey team. Each position has a different function. As starters:

Forwards: Very fast, quick reflexes, stay on offensive end

Midfielders: In great shape, run the most, help on offense and defense

Backs: Stay in the defensive zone, side to side movements, aggressive

Goalkeepers: Stay in goal circle, very little movement

#### Hypothesis
"Total Player Load" gives us the best prediction of a playerâ€™s positions. We believed that certain positions require different levels of work. Players who are capable of putting in more work perform better in certain positions.

#### Data cleaning
We started with 21,168 rows of data and went on to clean the dataset by removing some outliers and dropping some useless features.
```
# drop useless features
df.drop(['Period Number', 'Date_obj', 'Start Time', 'End Time', 'Day Name', 'Month Name'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# relabel target
df.loc[df['Position Name'] == 'Forward/Mid', 'Position Name'] = 'Mid/Forward'

# filter out bad high speed distance
df = df[(df["High Speed Distance"] < 1000)]
```

#### Feature engineering
We attempted to create some features based on positions.
```
df['forward_features'] = df['High Speed Distance'] + 
						   df['Maximum Velocity'] + 
						   df['Velocity Band 5 Total Distance']
```

#### Preprocessing
We normalized all the statistics based on players.
```
players = df["ID"].unique()
for player in players:
	ids = df[df["ID"] == player].index
	scaler = MinMaxScaler()
	df.loc[ids, features_n] = scaler.fit_transform(df.loc[ids, features_n])

LabelEncoder()
```

#### Modeling
We used `XGBoost` with a total of 27 features. By using different `n_estimators` and `learning_rate`, the best model achieved an accuracy of 92.7% with 4,504 of training data.

```
n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.2
n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05
n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.1
```

#### Mystery feature
Before performing any feature engineering, the feature importance from `XGBoost` is as follows:

But after adding a mystery feature, the new feature importance chart is as follows:

Here is the mystery factor for players of different positions:

#### Concluding remarks
This might be an interesting finding for hockey coaches to decide upon what position should a player be playing. In the end of the day, we do not want Christiano Ronaldo to be a goalkeeper, right?
